# AD-Click-Prediction
The Ad Click Prediction Model is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on their demographic attributes and online behavior. The goal of the model is to improve ad targeting, reduce ad spend wastage, and increase click-through rates (CTR) by identifying high-intent users

**Problem Statement**
Online advertisers want to know which users are most likely to click on their ads.
By predicting user click behavior, companies can:
1) Show ads to high-intent users
2) Reduce ad wastage
3) Improve campaign efficiency

This project uses machine learning to classify whether a user will click an ad (Clicked = 1 / Not Clicked = 0).

**Data Preprocessing**
Handled missing values, Converted categorical data into numerical form, Removed outliers, Normalized / scaled numeric features, Performed feature selection.

**Models Used**
The following ML models were trained and compared:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest Classifier
3) Decision Tree
4) K-Nearest Neighbors

**Evaluation metrics included:**
1) Accuracy
2) Precision
3) Recall
4) F1-Score

**Tech Stack**
1) Python
2) Pandas, NumPy
3) Scikit-learn
4) Matplotlib, Seaborn
5) Jupyter Notebook
